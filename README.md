# NWC Python Lite

The lightest weight demo sandbox of NWC in Python.

Starting with a simple script in main.py that runs a single NWC command and prints the result.

Some key components (event, key) were adapted from the excellent [python-nostr](https://github.com/jeffthibault/python-nostr/tree/main) library from @jeffthibault.
